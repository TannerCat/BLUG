          <h2>Saint Columban College</h2>
          <p>St. Columban&apos;s lifetime was devoted in selfless giving.  Though a son of a highborn Christian and belong to the nobility, his great love was to give himself to God in the loving service of God&apos;s children.  He decided to become a monk and came in contact with men famous for their holiness and who inspired him with a love for the sacred sciences. St. Columban was born in Leinter, Ireland, believed to be in 543 A.D. He was noble in his bearing and handsome.  He studied in his boyhood, probably learned his letters in his Psalter as other Irish saints and wrote Latin in the Sacred Scriptures.  When young Columban told his mother to leave home to become a monk, his mother utterly refused, however, his motherâ€™s pleading and refusal not to give him permission was to no avail.  He left his native Leinster, put himself under the care of a venerable man named Sinell in Cluain Inis, where the foundations of his learning were laid.  Sinell was famous for his holiness and for his learning in sacred things.  Under him, St. Columban was inspired with a love of the sacred sciences and taught how to think clearly and with intellectual curiosity and freedom.  After Cluain Inis, St. Columban decided to be a monk and set out for the monastery of Bangor, to place himself under the rule of Comghall, the most notable father of monks in Ireland, well known for his insistence on study and strict discipline.  He prayed, fasted, denied, and mortified himself, taking up his cross to follow Christ. </p>
